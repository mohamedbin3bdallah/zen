    <p dir="ltr" align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>What electrical standards do you 
    have? </b><strong>110 Volt</strong><b> or </b><strong>220 Volt</strong><b>?</b></font></p>
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, <b>ALL</b> of our lights will work with
    <b>BOTH</b> 110 volt and 220 volt. This voltage issue has an effect only on 
    the cross sectional area of the wiring. </font></p>
    <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">To check that deeper:</font></p>
    <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">Assume that the lamp will produce 100 watt, 
    electric power. So, to have the same power (P) in Country_A (V<sub>A</sub> = 
    110 voltage) and Country_B ( V<sub>B</sub> =220 voltage); </font></p>
    <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>P<sub>A </sub>= P<sub>B</sub></b>=>> <b> I<sub>A</sub> 
    X V<sub>A</sub> = I<sub>B</sub> X V<sub>B</sub></b>  >> <b>I<sub>A</sub> 
    / I<sub>B</sub> = 220/110 = 2</b>
    Which means that the current (<b>I</b>) required in country A to have the same 
    wattage is double the Current in country B. That means that the cross sectional area of your wires should 
    be double. So, we make our wiring according to the lower volttage.</font></p>
  <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Do you supply plugs?</b></font></p>
    <p align="justify" dir="ltr"><font face="Arial" size="2">Well, we are using here in Egypt the European standards for plugs. So, our 
plugs have round tips not flat as the north American plugs. So, <b>we can supply</b> 
    the European NOT the American plugs.</font></p>
